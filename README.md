**alimonia-ios** was the first attempt to bring the idea of *alimonia* to life as a native iOS app.
The app was intended to let users create personalized weekly nutrition plans and organize grocery shopping.

However, development was discontinued at a certain point, as the work shifted to a new cross-platform version: [**alimonia-app**](https://github.com/temmiland/alimonia-app), built with **Expo / React Native**.
